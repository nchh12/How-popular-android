# Note
This is my friend's exisiting project in which I had the opportunity to collaborate in a college course. I assisted him in developing and also designing the interface for the Word Definition or Dictionary screen, which mainly consists of implementing a modal bottom sheet and multiple JSON handling methods besides other task-related operations.
